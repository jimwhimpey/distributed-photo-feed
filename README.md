# Distributed Photo Feed

* Publish image assets to your own host
  Zach: We could also have them publish to ours with the option that they own the data, can export it any time. Like a twitter         archive.
* Update and publish a feed file ([JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org)?)
* Some kind of reader app for following/subscribing
  Zach: I'm thinking a React native app. But we'll need an intermediary server for uploads before we push to their server. We 
        should talk about the independent host / our host / json feed relationship

## Questions

* Identity? We should talk about how to do this. Maybe something with indieweb mechanisms.
* Likes? Yes.
* Can others write to your feed? Not for the first iteration.
* Comments? Not for the first iteration
